TODO List
- Import .akt files for certs and keygen
- Interaction with the Certs tab (copy sym, copy pub etc)
- Inline: relocations support (for dlls) or relocatable inline code (both can be done easily)
- Decrypt text1 (For inline patching)
- Automatic assembly using multimate assembler (can be done becasue I have a private lib from the creator of multimate assembler)
- Auto add 'GetProcAddress' for OutputDebugStringA (when needed, v5)
- Brute forced sym keys database (Save all brute forced keys in real time)
- License removal
- Security.dll extracting (maybe also replace, probably not)
- Watermark removing (for custom build)
- Random number brute/verification
- Nanomites
- Code splicing (Redirection adn deobfuscation)
- Check miscellaneous modules compatibility with new/old versions
